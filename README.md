# Music Bet

This project needs money to work with real money. It's like a casinò, but in this version I'm going to use fake virtual money, I'm going to code it as a "web game".
Users open the website and they view a short description with maybe a disclaimer (% of players are losing money). Then users can sign up or log in.
After loggin in, the first page users see a page in which they can choose what to do: listening to music (TO DEVELOP, it probably needs licenses), BETTING.

# LISTENING PAGE:
In the listening page users can easily listen to music such as many different music platforms.

# BETTING PAGE
In this page users can listen a preview of the song (e.g. 10 seconds, just as a feature) and then they can bet on songs.
In the beginning of the page there'll be a section in which new songs are shown; below another section of the most listened songs of the month and other section related with that.
For each song, there'll be a button clickable with written "BET". On the click, there'll be another page in which users can choose different [settings](#some-examples-of-settings) about the [current betting](#specific-song-betting-page).

# SPECIFIC SONG BETTING PAGE
There will be a chart with all timeframes available (this feature needs an advanced database, the chart initially would be only for "long term" timeframes).

# SOME EXAMPLES OF SETTINGS
- DURATION OF THE BET (similar to a bond, with expiration). As the owner, I would prefer a short duration in order to get the player play (for the addiction), and I prefer it can be limited upon 3 months
- MONEY
- LEVERAGE (up to 20x)
- 

# FUNDING REQUEST
In the footer, I would like to insert a section in which people can donate to get this project become real and users can use real money (maybe add some popups to ask to users to donate).
The necessary amount of money should be very high, since it's similar to a casinò so players who win gotta get paid somehow (put a limit of players in the beginning?).
